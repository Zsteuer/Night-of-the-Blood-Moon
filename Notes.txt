Things to talk about:
- Player needs to be named player
- Enemy needs its own layer
- Player 2 (NOT player 1) is most recent player prefab, not player
- Obstacles need RigidBodies for the enemy to jump over them
- Camera is now a prefab

Not important now, but worth watching when we add levels (only the first few minutes):
