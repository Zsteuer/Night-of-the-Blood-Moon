## ABOUT
This is Zach Steuer writing a README for a game Jason Veloz (J-Xetro on Github) and I made for a Game Design class in February 2019. I added some updates in May 2019. Without changing the game, I cleaned up the repo to make it public in January 2020. The last commit that I pushed before this was 87abe912653cc20096b810873b6b55c17e233019

I did most of the enemy AI and the camera script for when to follow the player.

Jason did the hitboxes, the locked door mechanic and about 80% of the animations, specifically the enemies.

Everything else was pretty evenly split.

## NOTE

There's two scenes, JScene and ZScene which we left in the repo but that were meant for debugging. They are not part of the game.
